# 🚀 Srdjan's GitHub Playground
Hey there! 👋 I'm Srdjan, a passionate software engineer from Serbia 🇷🇸, currently living in the Central European Time Zone. I split my time between Slovenia and Switzerland (about a third of the year in each), and I'm looking to move to Lisbon soon. 🌍

<br>

### 💻 What I Do
I'm a full-stack developer with a deep focus on frontend engineering and web3 development. Currently, I'm working at Seamless Protocol, helping build the next-gen DeFi experience.

### But let's be real—programming is more than just a job for me. ❤️‍🔥
It’s my passion, my craft, my favorite way to solve problems. 
When I’m not working, you’ll find me tinkering with new ideas, hacking away at side projects (check out my pinned repos 👇), and diving into new tech.

### 🏆 Tech & Skills
⚡ Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Chakra UI
⚡ Web3: Wagmi, Viem, ethers.js, smart contract integration
⚡ Backend: Node.js, Redis, GraphQL, Subgraphs, API design
⚡ Testing & DevOps: Cypress, Vitest, Sentry, CI/CD (Vercel, Docker, DigitalOcean)
⚡ Other: Data visualization, micro frontends, caching layers, performance optimizations

### 🎮 Beyond Code
When I’m not building products, I’m:
🎮 Playing Dota 2 (forever trying to escape the trench)
🏓 Hitting the padel courts
♟️ Thinking 10 moves ahead in chess (or at least trying to)
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Spending quality time with my family ❤️

### 🚀 Why Work With Me?
I don’t just write code—I think in systems and design solutions
I thrive in fast-moving startups and love building MVPs quickly
I have experience with micro frontends and large-scale DeFi architectures
I’m constantly improving and staying ahead of the curve in web3
